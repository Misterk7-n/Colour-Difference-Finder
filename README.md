# colour-difference-finder
Helps you find what turns &lt;colour A> into &lt;colour B>

I made a tool what helps you find the difference between two colours for my own use. I thought others would like to use it too, so I decided to make my first Repository (re-posit-orie, right?) for others to download. 

The resulting colour will always have an alpha transparency as it figures out what needs to be overlayed over A to get B. This is not a tool to find out what the median between two colours is or the difference between images. There are many other (better) tools on the internet for that, and this is not it.

Part of the reason I've decided to put it up on GitHub is because of how basic and rudimentary this project is. Feel free to add and improve on this project in any way you like, and i'll be sure to merge your changes into the main branch. A color picker, maybe?
