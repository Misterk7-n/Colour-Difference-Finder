# colour-difference-finder
Helps you find what turns &lt;colour A> into &lt;colour B>

I made a tool what helps you find the difference between two colours for my own use. I thought others would like to use it too, so I decided to make my first Repository (re-posit-orie, right?) for others to download. 

Part of the reason I've decided to put it up on GitHub is because of how basic and rudimentary this project is. Feel free to add and improve on this project in any way you like, and i'll be sure to merge your changes into the main branch. A color picker, maybe?
